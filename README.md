- 👋 Hi, everyone! I’m Yafie, thanks for coming to my repository 🙋🏽‍♂️
- 👀 As one with business and economics background from the get go, I know for a fact that learning anything data-related from scratch is hella scary
- 🌱 Hence, documenting every step of my learning is how I can navigate and refer back every knowledge and experiment I've ever come across
- 💞️ By no means can my repository be called a guide or walkthrough, but maybe for some of you, this could make learning seems a little less daunting!
- 📫 If you want to contact me, send me an email to: m.fauzanalyafie@gmail.com
